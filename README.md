# Data science for finance

## Introduction
This project aims to highlight the link between stock prices and news. You might say 'Dude it's obvious'. Yes it is! But how connected are they? 

## Data science
It almost is an end to end data project. We'll use a couple of APIs as data sources but then we'll do the cleaning, the analysis and the communication of the results. Moreover, we'll take up some advanced data science techniques in fields like:
* Natural Language Processing (NLP)
* Machine learning
* Statistics

## Data
For this project, I'll use data form [Quandl](https://www.quandl.com/) and [News API](https://newsapi.org/). Both of them are very-well designed. You just need an API key! Even though there is some premium content (Quandl), I did my whole analysis for free.

## Acknowledgement
Thank you to Quandl and News API teams. They really do an amazing work. And thank you to [Mattlisiv](https://github.com/mattlisiv) for its beautiful [Python client](https://github.com/mattlisiv/newsapi-python) for News API.
